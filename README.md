# NFT CARD WEB COMPONENT GALLERY

This project is a mini-gallery of fake NFT collections where you can show and hide the NFTs with a toggle switch. I created the cards and the toggle switch as reusable [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) for putting into practice what I've learned.
