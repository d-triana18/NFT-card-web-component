# NFT CARD WEB COMPONENT GALLERY

This project is a mini-gallery of fake NFT collections where you can show and hide the NFTs with a toggle switch. I created the cards and the toggle switch as reusable [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) for putting into practice what I've learned.

<h3>WORK FLOW</h3>

I started with a mobile-first approach, completing the HTML structure and styles for both of the components. Then I used the Web Components APIs to create my custom elements (tags) and set their attributes and CSS custom properties to make them highly customizable. After that, I added the show/hide functionality and finally started to optimize the page for deployment.
